# Proxy Server

## Description
This is one of projects in Computer Networking subject.
Build a proxy server using socket programming, here we use Python for simple implementing.
Proxy server play a mediate role, between two sides: client and server.
* Client sends a request to proxy, if expected host is not banned, it will forward the request to server, otherwise, it will simply send a error html page to client immediately.
* As soon as server receives the request from proxy, it responds to proxy, then, proxy forwards the response to client.
This supports for HTTP protocol only.

## Prerequisites
Make sure that you have installed a version of Python (the lasted version is recommended).

## Usage
Configure proxy server in a browser (Firefox is pretty easy to try), set your HTTP proxy is 127.0.0.1 and port is 8888.
Any tutorial or report, I will update in next commits.
